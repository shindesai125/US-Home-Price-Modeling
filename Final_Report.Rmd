# üåç Project Objective

To model and analyze the key economic, demographic, and housing-related factors influencing US home prices over the past two decades using publicly available data and machine learning techniques.

# üìä Data Collection & Preprocessing

- **Data Sources (Public & Official):**
  - S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index (FRED)  
  - 30-Year Fixed Rate Mortgage Average (FRED)  
  - Unemployment Rate (FRED)  
  - Median Household Income (US Census Bureau)  
  - Housing Starts (FRED)  
  - Consumer Price Index (FRED)  
  - Population Estimates (US Census Bureau)

- **Datasets Used:**
  - S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index (Target)  
  - Mortgage Rates  
  - Unemployment Rate  
  - Median Household Income  
  - Housing Starts  
  - Consumer Price Index (CPI)  
  - Population Estimates (2000‚Äì2025)

- **Key Data Decisions:**
  - Chose S&P Case-Shiller HPI as the target due to its reliability and coverage.  
  - Used monthly granularity across all datasets for uniformity.  
  - Handled missing values using forward-fill/backward-fill techniques.  
  - ROI analysis was not performed due to the absence of cost or revenue data in the dataset.

- **Preprocessing Steps:**
  - Converted all date columns to a unified datetime format.  
  - Merged datasets chronologically on a monthly basis.

```

- Created a unified dataframe `master_df1` with 243 rows and 13 features.

- **Visualization Tools:**
  - I prioritized more statistically rigorous visualizations using Python (Seaborn/Matplotlib) to ensure interpretability and precision.  
  - Tableau was explored, but Python visuals were found more suitable for this modeling-based analysis.

# üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Key Findings:**
  - Strong positive correlation between CPI and Home Prices.  
  - Unemployment and Mortgage Rates showed weaker correlation.  
  - HPI demonstrated an upward trend, impacted by events like the 2008 recession and COVID-19.  
  - Seasonal patterns in Housing Starts; CPI and Unemployment showed economic cycles.

- **Visualization Techniques:**
  - Correlation heatmap  
  - Trend analysis with line plots  
  - Distribution check with histograms and boxplots  
  - Applied rolling averages for smoothing volatility

# üéôÔ∏è Feature Engineering

- **New Features Created:**
  - `HPI_rolling`: 12-month moving average of HPI  
  - `Post_COVID`: Binary feature marking post-March 2020 period  
  - `Log_Unemployment`: Log transformation to handle skewness in unemployment rate  
  - `CPI_Growth`: Monthly % change in CPI  
  - `Mortgage_Rate_Level`: Categorized mortgage rates into Low, Medium, High

- **Encoding:**
  - `Mortgage_Rate_Level` transformed using `OrdinalEncoder`

# ‚öñÔ∏è Modeling

- **Train-Test Split:**
  - Time-based chronological split (80% train, 20% test) to preserve temporal patterns  
  - Avoided random split to maintain causality and avoid data leakage

- **Models Trained:**
  - Linear Regression: baseline model  
  - Random Forest Regressor: ensemble model chosen for robustness

- **Performance Metrics:**

| Model             | R¬≤ Score | RMSE   |
|------------------|----------|--------|
| Linear Regression| 0.9992   | 0.0102 |
| Random Forest    | 0.9998   | 0.0023 |

# üí° Residual Analysis

- **Linear Regression:**
  - Slight funnel shape in residuals ‚Üí mild heteroscedasticity  
  - Histogram slightly skewed but still bell-shaped

- **Random Forest:**
  - Residuals tightly centered around zero with no visible pattern  
  - Histogram appears normally distributed

**Conclusion:** Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression in terms of error structure and fit.

# üéØ Feature Importance

- **Top Predictors from Random Forest:**

| Feature              | Importance |
|----------------------|------------|
| Home_Price_Index     | 0.347      |
| HPI_rolling          | 0.270      |
| CPI                  | 0.206      |
| Population_Monthly   | 0.120      |

- These four features accounted for over 90% of model predictive power.

- **Negligible Features:**
  - Mortgage_Rate, Housing_Starts, Month, CPI_Growth, Mortgage_Rate_Level  
  - Low importance attributed to high collinearity or minimal monthly variation

# üîÅ Re-training with Top Features

- **Why:** To simplify the model without compromising accuracy  
- **Action:** Re-trained Random Forest using top 4 features only  
- **Outcome:**

  - R¬≤ Score: 0.9997  
  - RMSE: 0.0042  

**Decision Justification:** Acceptable performance drop; model stays reliable while being easier to understand

# üíæ Model Exporting

- **Final model exported as:** `final_random_forest_model.pkl`  
- **Format:** joblib or pickle  
- **Reusable in** production pipelines or Flask-based apps

# üìÑ Deliverables

- Jupyter Notebook: Includes EDA, modeling, and evaluation  
- Final Report: This document

# üìä Final Thoughts & Takeaways

- The project highlighted major economic patterns that influenced US housing prices.  
- Historical pricing, CPI, and population growth were key influencers.  
- Creating new features like rolling averages and transformations made the model perform noticeably better.  
- Using a time-based split was essential to keep the evaluation realistic and prevent data leakage.  
- Random Forest gave the most accurate results and helped explain which features mattered most.
